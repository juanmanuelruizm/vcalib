# vcalib — Differentiable Calibration Filters for RF-DETR Under Illumination Shift

> **Stop retraining your detector when the lighting changes.** Fit a ~2 KB filter in minutes on a CPU instead — the model stays frozen.

---

vcalib learns a tiny preprocessing filter that undoes an illumination shift *before* the image reaches a frozen object detector. No model weights are touched. On **real captured image pairs, held out from training**, a single spatial tone-curve filter pulls the shifted image's internal representation **35.9% closer** to the reference — fit in ~3.5 min on a laptop CPU.

*Left to right: the reference condition **A**, the same scene under shifted lighting **B**, the filter-corrected `filter(B)`, and where the filter helped (green = closer to A). These are real held-out scenes the filter never saw during training.*

---

## Why this matters (the production case)

Think about what it costs to keep a detector working as conditions drift — dawn vs. dusk, indoor vs. overcast, a new camera, a new site. The textbook answer is "collect data, label it, fine-tune, redeploy." That is the expensive answer.

vcalib proposes the cheap one: **freeze the expensive model once, and adapt to each new condition with a tiny, label-free filter.** It's the same economic logic that made LoRA/adapters win in NLP — only here we adapt the model's *input* instead of its weights.

![Retrain vs. vcalib](docs/images/economics.png)

In deployment this becomes **one frozen model + a swappable library of tiny filters**, one per condition. Switching conditions is swapping a 2 KB file — no retraining, no redeploy.

> **Why we're excited:** if this holds at the *detection-metric* level (our next milestone — see [What's proven vs. what's next](#whats-proven-vs-whats-next)), then keeping a model healthy in the field stops being a retraining problem and becomes a *calibration* problem — orders of magnitude cheaper, no labels, runs on the edge.

## The Problem

RF-DETR is a state-of-the-art real-time object detector. Like most vision models, it is sensitive to illumination: deploy it under lighting different from its training distribution and detection quality degrades. Retraining or fine-tuning is expensive and impractical for edge devices.

The images below show one scene captured under three real lighting conditions — exactly the kind of shift that moves a model's internal features off-distribution:

## How it works

Loss = mean{ ||act_A[l] - act_filtered_B[l]|| / ||act_A[l]|| }
       for l in chosen layer group
     + reg_weight · filter.reg_loss()
        │
        ▼
Adam optimizer → filter params updated, model frozen
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Signal = intermediate activations, not pixel L2.** We match RF-DETR's internal representations, not raw pixels. That makes the objective *task-aware* without needing any labels — the filter optimizes for what the detector actually keys on, not for human-perceived color. This is the crucial difference from a classic white-balance / ISP correction.
- **Filter operates pre-normalization** on the `[0, 1]` RGB tensor, before ImageNet mean/std normalization.
- **No model weights modified.** The frozen model is a fixed feature extractor; only the filter is learnable.
- **Layer group as a search axis.** We sweep which group of RF-DETR layers feeds the loss. The `backbone.projector` consistently wins.
- **Held-out validation guardrail.** Every calibration is evaluated on held-out pairs to catch overfitting. An overfit gate (val/train ≥ 0.5) rejects degenerate configs.

## Results on real captured pairs

The headline figure above and the chart below come from training the top filter (`spatial_tone_curve`, P=16, K=5, on `projector`) on **24 real captured scenes** and evaluating on **6 scenes held out entirely from training**.

![Activation recovery on held-out scenes](docs/images/activation_recovery.png)

| | Result |
|---|---|
| Mean activation-distance reduction (6 held-out scenes) | **35.9%** |
| Per-scene range | 6.5% – 52.6% |
| Filter parameters | 1,200 |
| Fit time | ~211 s on a laptop CPU (24 pairs, 60 epochs) |
| Model weights changed | **0** |

And it converges fast — most of the recovery lands in the first ~15 epochs (real per-epoch metrics):

## Results (200-Config Sweep)

> 10 filter types × 2 illumination levels × 10 layer groups, evaluated on 6 held-out test scenes (synthetically relighted, used as a fast proxy).
> Metric: mean activation-distance reduction on the test set (higher = better).

### Top Configurations

| Rank | Filter | Layer Group | Level | Test Reduction |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | `spatial_tone_curve` (P=8, K=3) | `projector` | L1→L2 | **30.7%** |
| 2 | `lut_3d` (N=9) | `projector` | L1→L2 | 29.6% |
| 3 | `tone_curve` (P=16) | `projector` | L1→L2 | 24.1% |
| 4 | `ccm_high_order` | `projector` | L1→L2 | 23.7% |
| 5 | `lut_3d` (N=9) | `projector` | L1→L3 | 23.9% |
| 6 | `spatial_tone_curve` (P=8, K=3) | `projector` | L1→L3 | 21.6% |
| 7 | `lut_3d` (N=9) | `backbone.late+proj` | L1→L2 | 21.0% |

### Key Findings

**1. Layer group matters more than filter type.**
The `projector` layer (the backbone's multi-scale feature projector) gives the strongest signal across every filter type. Results degrade progressively from late → mid → early backbone layers.

![Layer group comparison](docs/images/layer_group_comparison.png)

**2. Non-linear filters outperform linear ones.**
Spatial and tone-curve filters capture the non-linear, per-channel character of real illumination shifts better than affine transforms.

![Filter type comparison](docs/images/filter_comparison.png)

**3. The signal generalizes across illumination levels.**
Results on `level_1→level_3` (stronger shift) are slightly lower but follow the same filter/group ranking — the approach isn't tied to one shift magnitude.

## What's proven vs. what's next

We'd rather be precise about what these numbers do and don't show.

**✅ What's proven**
- A tiny, label-free filter measurably pulls a frozen detector's internal representations back toward the reference condition — **35.9% on real held-out captured pairs**, 30.7% across a 200-config synthetic sweep.
- It's cheap: thousands of params, minutes on a CPU, no model retraining, no labels.
- The signal is robust: same ranking across filter families, layer groups, and shift magnitudes.

**🔧 What's next (the milestone that closes the loop)**
- **Detection-metric recovery.** Activation distance is a strong *proxy*; the proof a practitioner wants is mAP / box-quality / confidence on real shifted data: *baseline vs. filter vs. full retrain*. We've started this — there are detection-loss calibration runs in `results/experiments/runs/det_*` — and it's the headline goal of Phase 3.
- **Per-condition generalization.** Confirm that one filter, fit once per environment, holds across a whole stream of frames (the deployment model above), not just per-image.
- **Edge deploy CLI** to make "fit & swap a filter" a one-command operation.

## FAQ

**Isn't this just white balance / histogram matching?**
No — and that's the point. Classic ISP corrections optimize for human-perceived color. vcalib optimizes a *task-aware* objective: it minimizes the distance between the frozen detector's **activations**, so it corrects exactly what the model cares about. Linear color transforms (`white_balance`, `affine`) are *included* in the filter library and they consistently underperform the non-linear, activation-matched filters.

**Where does the reference A come from at deploy time?**
You capture a small set of A/B pairs once per new environment, fit the filter offline, freeze it, and ship it. At inference you only run `filter(frame) → frozen model`. No reference is needed online.

**Does it actually improve detection, or just activations?**
Today we measure activation-distance recovery (a proxy) — see [What's proven vs. what's next](#whats-proven-vs-whats-next). Detection-metric recovery is the active milestone.

**Why freeze the model instead of fine-tuning?**
Cost and operations: no labels, minutes on CPU vs. GPU-hours, a 2 KB artifact vs. a new checkpoint, and one model + N swappable filters instead of N fine-tuned models to maintain.

## Filter Library

18 parametric filters + 1 neural network filter, all sharing the same interface:

```python
filter(x: Tensor[B, 3, H, W] in [0,1]) → Tensor[B, 3, H, W] in [0,1]
# identity init: filter(x) == x at construction
# end-to-end differentiable
```

| Category | Filter | Params | Targets |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Global linear** | `brightness_2param` | 2 | global exposure |
| | `white_balance_3param` | 3 | per-channel gains |
| | `affine_6param` | 6 | per-channel affine |
| | `saturation_1param` | 1 | saturation |
| | `contrast_1param` | 1 | global contrast |
| | `gamma_3param` | 3 | per-channel gamma |
| | `matrix_12param` | 12 | 3×3 CCM + offset |
| **Spatial** | `spatial_brightness` | K²·1 | zone-dependent exposure |
| | `spatial_whitebalance` | K²·3 | zone-dependent WB |
| | `spatial_affine` | K²·6 | zone-dependent affine |
| | `spatial_gamma` | K²·3 | zone-dependent gamma |
| **Non-linear** | `lut_3d` | 3·N³ (N=9→2187) | full RGB→RGB LUT |
| | `tone_curve` | 3·P (P=16→48) | monotone per-channel curves |
| | `ccm_high_order` | 3·F+3 | root-polynomial CCM |
| | `chromatic_adaptation` | 3–9 | Bradford LMS adaptation |
| | `spatial_tone_curve` | 3·P·K² | zone-dependent tone curves |
| | `local_tonemap` | K²+1 | CLAHE-like guided gain |
| | `lut_3d_lowrank` | M·(3N+1) | low-rank LUT |
| **Neural** | `neural_pixel` | ~1283 (configurable) | universal approximator |

Spatial filters use a bilinear K×K control grid (`grid_sample`). Default K=3.
`neural_pixel` is a pixel-wise residual MLP: `f(x) = clamp(x + MLP(x), 0, 1)`, identity-initialized.

## How Experiments Work

Each experiment is a single YAML config:

```yaml
name: level2_neural_pixel_projector
dataset: data/datasets/level_1_vs_level_2
filter:
  type: neural_pixel
  hidden_dim: 32
  depth: 2
layer_group:
  name: projector
  layers:
  - backbone.projector
training:
  max_epochs: 100
  learning_rate: 0.001
  reg_weight: 0.001
  early_stopping_patience: 10
  seed: 42
```

The runner (`run_configs.py`) loads the model once, iterates configs, and writes incremental results. Each run saves `best.pt` (best filter weights) and `metrics.jsonl` (per-epoch stats) under `results/experiments/runs/<name>/`.
